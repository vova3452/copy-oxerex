Spawn entities on death:
    Special properties:
        - BROADCAST_MESSAGE: "string" // Message when the entity dies
        - FRAG_SPAWNS: ["exportName", "exportName"] // Entities spawn when the entity dies (Must be the EXPORT NAME, not exports.basic, just "basic")
    Example:
        exports.sentryFragBoss = makeAuto({
            PARENT: [exports.elite],
            LABEL: "Mega Sentry",
            TURRTES: (function() {
                const output = [];
                const sentryNames = ["sentrySwarm", "sentryGun", "sentryTrap"];
                for (let i = 0; i < 3; i ++) {
                    output.push({
                        POSITION: [8, 8, 0, 360 / 3 * i + 60, 0, 1],
                        TYPE: exports[sentryNames[i]]
                    });
                }
                return output;
            })(),
            // SPAWN ENTITIES ON DEATH
            BROADCAST_MESSAGE: "The Mega Sentry may have fallen, but the battle is not yet over...",
            FRAG_SPAWNS: ["sentrySwarm", "sentryGun", "sentryTrap"]
            // END SPAWN ENTITIES ON DEATH
        }, "Mega Sentry", {
            type: exports.director,
            color: 5
        });

Special guns:
    Special properties:
        - COLOR: 10 // The color INDEX that changes the color of the gun
        - SKIN: 2 // THE ID of the gun shape
    Example:
        exports.flamethrowerMK2 = {
            PARENT: [exports.genericTank],
            LABEL: "Flamethrower MK2",
            DANGER: 7,
            BODY: {
                SPEED: base.SPEED * .9,
                ACCELERATION: base.ACCELERATION * .9
            },
            GUNS: [{
                POSITION: [20, 10, 1.2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                PROPERTIES: {
                    SHOOT_SETTINGS: combineStats([g.basic, g.mach, g.flamethrower, g.pound]),
                    TYPE: exports.bullet,
                    // SPECIAL GUNS
                    SKIN: 1,
                    COLOR: 9
                    // END SPECIAL GUNS
                }
            }]
        };

Automated guns:
    Skills needed:
        - Understanding of "for" loops
        - Understanding of arrays, and the "push" method
        - Understanding of the % operator
        - Understanding of basic JS math
    Notes based on skills:
        - Inside the for loop, you can reference "i" - the index - to do some math based on the index.
        - In the example, we modify the lendth of each gun. It is 12 plus 20 * (i / 16). (i / 16) is going to return a decimal of how far we are. (8 / 16) => .5
        - To determine the angle of the guns, we use 360 / 16 * i. Breaking this down, 360 is the full circle. Dividing it by the total amount of guns (16) gives us the angle space between each gun. Multiplying it by i lets us get the proper angle.
        - To do delay, we use the % operator. In i % 4, we take I and do modulus division with it. (Getting the remainder) 5 % 4 would be 1. Multiplying this by .25 lets us make proper delay for guns based on four separate ticks.
    Example:
        exports.hexadecaTank = {
            PARENT: [exports.genericTank],
            LABEL: "Hexadeca Tank",
            DANGER: 8,
            BODY: {
                SPEED: base.SPEED * .9,
                ACCELERATION: base.ACCELERATION * .9
            },
            // AUTOMATED GUNS
            GUNS: (function() {
                // Create a list to return
                const output = [];
                // Loop 16 times
                for (let i = 0; i < 16; i ++) {
                    // Push a gun object to the output list
                    output.push({
                        POSITION: [12 + (i / 16 * 20), 8, 1, 0, 0, 360 / 16 * i, (i % 4) * .25],
                        PROPERTIES: {
                            SHOOT_SETTINGS: combineStats([g.bullet, g.flank, g.flank]),
                            TYPE: exports.bullet
                        }
                    });
                    // Return the guns out
                    return output;
                }
            })()
            // END AUTOMATED GUNS
        };
